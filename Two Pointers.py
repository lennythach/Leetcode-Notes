If you ever need to return 3 values from and array it most likely require 0(n**2) approach.
Best way to do it is: 
    - by using a for loop for the 1st value
    - use a two pointer to get the the other 2 value

BIG TAKE AWAY:
    DONT BE AFRAID TO GO FOR A NLOGN SOLUTION!!!!
    use the sorting as long as you can get the answer first.
    NOT ALL PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN O(N) SOLUTION
